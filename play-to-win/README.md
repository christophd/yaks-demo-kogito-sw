# Kogito Serverless Workflow Demo

This test verifies a Serverless workflow project implemented with Kogito.
Create your serverless workflow file (*.sw.json) under folder src/main/resources.

# Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

It runs locally on port 8080.

Open up http://localhost:8080 to get a web page that allows you to send a CloudEvent to start the workflow.

## Building an image

This is meant to produce a Knative image, to be pushed to quay.io. Update the application.properties to use your own repository.

To build your image, run:
```
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
```

You can push your image using:
```
docker push quay.io/{YOUR_USERNAME}/kogito-serverless-workflow-demo:1.1
```
